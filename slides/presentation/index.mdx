# Realtime Web Apps With Websockets + Hooks
## Kyle Cesmat
Software Engineer at Formidable

### The Challenge
* UI with ~6 realtime websocket interfaces
* Some of these components are charts/graphs with many DOM nodes
* 300ms render target
* Maintain performance

<InterfaceDemo />

<InterfaceDemo isFlashing={true} isRandom={true}/>

### Where we landed
- Websocket connections update singular store
- Use rxjs to 'scan' for updates every 300ms
- Singular `setState` call, triggering update to components

<img src={StateOverview} height="100%" width="100%"/>

<InterfaceDemo isFlashing={true}/>

### Lessons learned
- Requires _all_ sockets to be opened if you only want one entity
- Doesn't scale well, we're setting a lot of state at once
- We can take advantage of hooks now that it's shipped ðŸŽ£
---
### What are hooks?
- They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
- Provides _opinions_ about managing state
- Extensible, functional, and will blow your mind
